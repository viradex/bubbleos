# BubbleOS Changelog

This is the official BubbleOS changelog! All features will be recorded in _'groups'_, and the latest version of that _'group'_ will have an executable and a release paired with them.

## Build 225 to 2?? (v2.2.5-beta to v2.?.?-beta)

### Added Features

- Added better value display to the `fs` command, showing a percentage bar of the space used for each partition as well as information displayed in a more human-readable format. The `-a` argument can be used to get more advanced information.
- Added better value display to the `cpu` command, showing the CPU installed and specifications of it. The `-a` argument can be used to get more advanced information.
- Added better value display to the `users` command, showing the username and time of login. The `-a` argument can be used to get more advanced information.
- Added better value display to the `os` command, showing the OS, release number, UEFI support, and computer name/FQDN. The `-a` argument can be used to get more advanced information.

### Changed/Fixed Features

- Fixed an issue where the `stat` command would always show the size of files and directories as 0 bytes.

### Removed Features

_No removed features._

## Build 217 to 225 (v2.1.7-beta to v2.2.5-beta)

### Added Features

- Added the `extract` command, which extracts files from a ZIP file into a specified folder.
- Added the `fs` command, which gives information about the file system of different drives.
- Added functionality for the following commands: `audio`, `battery`, `bluetooth`, `cpu`, `disks`, `env`, `graphics`, `hardware`, `mem`, `os`, `printer`, `usb`, and `users`. The values are currently printed with lots of technical information and without much formatting, which will be changed in future versions.
- Added a loading spinner for the following commands: `audio`, `battery`, `bluetooth`, `cpu`, `disks`, `graphics`, `hardware`, `mem`, `os`, `printer`, `usb`, and `users`.

### Changed/Fixed Features

- Changed the CLI prompt to use the one used in Build 180 to Build 200 RC3, to allow compatibility with the loading spinner used in commands.

### Removed Features

- Removed the code for battery information in `sysinfo`.

## Build 209 to 217 (v2.0.9-beta to v2.1.7-beta)

### Added Features

- Added the `editfile` command, which allows the editing of files in the default editor in a temporary file.
- Added the `archive` command, which compresses a directory into a ZIP archive. This command also features a progress bar, which may be added to other commands.
- Added the `tictactoe` command, which lets you play Tic-Tac-Toe!
- Added the `qrcode` command, which generates a QR code that leads to the link entered. It also generates an image of the QR code and saves it.
- Added the `env` and `users` commands, which currently have no functionality.
- Added the ability to get help for a command when using `/?` as the first argument on it.

### Changed/Fixed Features

## Build 200 to 209 (v2.0.0 to v2.0.9-beta)

### Added Features

- Added the `snake` and `tetris` commands, which allows you to play Snake and Tetris, respectively! Includes high score storage in the configuration file. More games may be added in the future (they take a while to code though)!
- Added the following commands: `audio`, `battery`, `bluetooth`, `cpu`, `disks`, `graphics`, `hardware`, `mem` (also `ram`), `os`, `printer`, and `usb`. These are currently non-functional.
- Added category sorting to the `help` command, which sorts commands based on the category.
- Added a detection for the Node.js version that BubbleOS is running on. If it is detected to be below version 22, BubbleOS will crash on startup.

### Changed/Fixed Features

- Changed the function of the number argument in `history`, as it will now show the amount of commands that was requested (e.g. `history 10` will show the last ten commands).
- The command history will no longer save commands if they are the same as the previously stored command in history.
- The command history now stores up to 100 commands, rather than 50.
- Changed colors used in the `help` command.
- Changed internal command file structure.
- The warning for BubbleOS crashing will no longer show on startup if an error information file was not saved.

### Removed Features

_No removed features._

## Build 200 RC4 to 200 (v2.0.0-rc4 to v2.0.0)

### Added Features

- Added a message that appears when BubbleOS checks for updates, and informs the user if the operation was successful or if there was an error connecting to the server.
- Added the `--delete` argument to the BubbleOS executable, which deletes the BubbleOS configuration file entirely.
- Added some easter eggs! ;)

### Changed/Fixed Features

- Optimized directory size calculations for the `stat` command, resulting in a 2x performance improvement.
- Changed the `stat` command to automatically retrieve the stats of the current directory if no path is specified.
- Changed all references from "folder" to "directory" to help create a consistency of terminology usage.
- Changed the `sysinfo` CPU information so that the speed will not be outputted if it is zero, and the CPU information will not be shown if BubbleOS is unable to get CPU information.
- Fixed an issue where the `time` command would not show times in AM/PM format by default.
- Fixed an issue where showing path basenames would show an empty string when at the root of a drive.
- Fixed an issue where reading an empty directory with `dirtree` would not show a message saying the directory was empty.
- Fixed an issue where the alphabetical sorting of the `sysinfo` command would sort by words starting with uppercase letters first.
- Fixed an issue where the `dirtree` command would not show an empty line after showing the tree.
- Fixed an issue where the `tasklist` and `taskkill` commands would crash if they could not get the process list.
- Fixed an issue where the `symlink` command crashed if making a symbolic link was unable to be done.
- Fixed an issue where if the history in the configuration file was not a valid data type, BubbleOS would crash and bootloop instead of fixing the issue automatically.

### Removed Features

- Removed support for release candidates. Configuration files containing release candidate data will be removed upon booting into this version.
- Removed the "this may take a while message" when the path being copied in the `copy` command is over 250MB, to improve performance.

## Build 200 RC3 to 200 RC4 (v2.0.0-rc3 to v2.0.0-rc4)

### Added Features

_No added features._

### Changed/Fixed Features

- Significantly improved performance of the command interpreter and `taskkill` command.
- Reverted the changes from a few builds ago to use the older prompt, to allow cycling through previous commands on Windows. This may be fixed in a future build.
- The `symlink` command no longer requires the `-c` argument to check if a path is a symbolic link. Instead, if one path is entered, the command will automatically check if the specified path is a symbolic link.
- Modified the internal system of executing files in the `exec` command, allowing it to be faster and more flexible.
- Changed the environment variables displayed in the `sysinfo` command to be alphabetically sorted.
- The short view in the `ls` command now has folders bolded rather than highlighted.
- Changed the _exiting BubbleOS shell_ message to be bolded.
- Edited some tips to be correct due to recent changes.
- Fixed an issue where entering a period at the end of a URL in the `ping` command would cause it to crash.
- Fixed an issue where the `mkfile` and `mkdir` commands would crash if the file/directory could not be deleted if it already exists.
- Fixed an issue where the `symlink` command would crash if the symbolic link path already existed when making a symbolic link.
- Fixed an issue where the `link` command would crash if unlinking a directory that was not a symbolic link.
- Fixed an issue where the `link` command would allow the hard linking of directories, which would always cause an incorrect permission error.
- Fixed an issue where the `sysinfo` command would print the CPU speed twice on some systems.
- Fixed an issue where the description of the non-fatal error in the `crash` command described it as a fatal error.
- Fixed an issue where the _terminating BubbleOS process_ text in the fatal error was no longer bolded.
- Fixed an issue where the BubbleOS name was hardcoded in some areas.
- Slightly changed the error message in the `crash` command.

### Removed Features

- Removed the ability for the following commands to run in the pre-boot interpreter: `cd`, `exit`, `history`, `setmgr`, and `tips`.
- Removed the `-c` argument from the `symlink` command. To check if a path is a symbolic link, simply enter one path.
- Removed the `-u` (and `-y`, as a side-effect) arguments from the `link` command. To unlink a link or symbolic link, use the `del` command.
- Removed the `--sh` argument from the `exec` command, due to it being slower and unsafe (allowed command injection), and the `-h` argument.

## Build 200 RC2 to 200 RC3 (v2.0.0-rc2 to v2.0.0-rc3)

### Added Features

- Added the non-fatal error, which occurs when BubbleOS encounters an error that it can recover from. The fatal error still occurs when a critical component crashes. Note that the non-fatal error still shows a bug in BubbleOS, like the fatal error, and should be reported. The difference is that it does not end the BubbleOS process.
- Added compatibility for release candidates to the update checker.
- Added the time of crash to the fatal error information file.

### Changed/Fixed Features

- Changed the requirement for entering the 'all' keyword in `hash` to show all hashes; now to show all hashes, nothing has to be entered.
- Fixed an issue where some commands would crash when interacting with files ([#17](https://github.com/viradex/bubbleos/issues/17)).
- Fixed an issue where the `symlink` command would crash when attempting to create a symbolic link.
- Fixed an issue where the `symlink` command would crash if the target path and source were the same.
- Fixed an issue where the `copy` command would crash when copying a file/directory to a subdirectory of itself.
- Fixed an issue where the absolute path verbose message would always show _undefined_.
- Fixed an issue where the help message for the `history` command would not show information about the `-c` argument.
- Fixed an inconsistency issue where the fatal error information file would not have leading zeros in the date.

### Removed Features

- Removed the `--no-intro` flag from the BubbleOS executable.

## Build 200 RC1 to 200 RC2 (v2.0.0-rc1 to v2.0.0-rc2)

### Added Features

- Added safeguards against renaming the BubbleOS configuration file using `rename`, to prevent BubbleOS from thinking the file was deleted.
- Added a message for the first introduction of BubbleOS to inform how to change the settings.

### Changed/Fixed Features

- The `rename` command now keeps the directory in its original location when renaming it. Previously, if the new name didn’t include a directory, the command would move the renamed directory to the current working directory. Now, it updates the name without changing its location.
- Updated the confirmation and success messages in the `taskkill` command to display the process name instead of the PID when using the PID.
- Changed the timeout in the `ping` command from 10 seconds to 5 seconds.
- Fixed a formatting error in the `ping` command where the success code would not have an closing bracket.
- Fixed an issue where BubbleOS would crash upon encountering the `ENXIO` error.
- Fixed an issue where the `taskkill` command would detect if the process did not exist after the confirmation prompt was accepted when using PIDs.
- Fixed an issue where the `taskkill` command would crash BubbleOS when it successfully killed a process.
- Fixed an issue where the `cd` command would count the tilde (`~`) as valid if it was anywhere in the path, instead of the first character.
- Fixed an issue where the configuration file version checker would fail to detect an upgrade in some cases.
- Fixed an issue where the version in the configuration file would not update if the configuration file did not require a reset.

### Removed Features

_No removed features._

- BubbleOS now checks if the configuration file is corrupted after a command executes.
- Fixed an issue where pressing Ctrl+C while having exit prompts enabled would cause BubbleOS to freeze if "no" was entered.
- Fixed an issue where pressing Ctrl+C while a command was executing would not exit BubbleOS, and freeze the shell instead.
- Fixed an issue where pressing Ctrl+C while on the prompt in `mkfile` would crash BubbleOS.

### Removed Features

- Removed the silence (usually `-s`) flags from most commands in favor of the setting in `setmgr`.
- The `history` command will no longer attempt to reset the configuration file upon an error occurring.

- Internally moved the `cwd` command to a separate file and fixed an issue where it had no verbose messages.
- Internally added, edited and removed comments.

### Removed Features

- Removed the `size` command, in favor of the `stat` command.
- Removed the `--kill-self` argument for the `taskkill` command. BubbleOS now allows killing its process by default.
- Removed the ability to use the up-arrow key to cycle through previous commands, however, this functionality was broken on Linux and macOS (and in some cases, in Windows). This may be reintroduced in a future version.
- Removed the leniency of yes/no prompts, so that only _y_ or _yes_ are accepted. This may be reintroduced in a future version.
- Removed an Easter egg :(

- Internally removed the `caseSensitivePath`, `convertAbsolute`, and `parseDoubleQuotes` functions in favor of the `PathUtil` class.

## Build 167 to 180 (v1.6.7-beta to v1.8.0-beta)

### Added Features

- Added the ability to kill processes by specifying the process name instead of the PID in `taskkill` (PIDs are still supported).
- The `sysinfo` command now displays the battery percentage and if the battery is on charge, if the device has a battery.
- Added an option to crash the device with a Blue Screen of Death on Windows using the `crash` command. **This is a very dangerous option!**
- Added safeguards against deleting the BubbleOS configuration file.
- Added a check to see if BubbleOS crashed the last time it ran. If it did, a warning message will show on startup.
- Added a startup check to make sure the terminal supports color. If not, BubbleOS will end prematurely.

### Changed/Fixed Features

- Improved the selection algorithm of the `tips` command, so that it is impossible to fail finding a tip, and when there are no more tips to show, it will reset automatically.
- The color for memory in `sysinfo` now has yellow text for if the memory usage is around the middle.
- The information in the `sysinfo` command now shows bolded instead of italicized.
- Increased the timeout time in the `ping` command from 5 seconds to 15 seconds.

_No removed features._

## Build 148 to 167 (v1.4.8-beta to v1.6.7-beta)

- The verbose feature has been fully implemented. Unlike previous versions, the verbose flag can only be used on the BubbleOS executable itself, by running it with the `--verbose` flag.
- If the specified file/directory exists when running `mkfile`/`mkdir`, BubbleOS will ask whether or not to delete the file/directory instead of failing.
- BubbleOS will no longer display the full intro after opening on the system once to reduce clutter.
- Added the `-h`/`--help` flag to the BubbleOS executable, which displays all the BubbleOS startup arguments and what they do.
- Added the `--reset` flag to the BubbleOS executable, which resets the configuration file.
- Added the ability to use double quotes in the `tasklist` command.
- Internally added the `InfoMessages` and `ConfigManager` classes.

- The `sysinfo` command will no longer display the tip after the first time it shows.
- Fixed an issue where the `cd` command would not be case-sensitive on Windows, as well as other commands ([#15](https://github.com/viradex/bubbleos/issues/15)).
- Fixed an issue where the `ping` and `tasklist` commands would fail to execute in the pre-boot interpreter.
- Fixed an issue where the `bub` command would be caught in an infinite loop if the `.bub` file was executing the same file as it was running.
- Fixed an issue where commands executing in a `.bub` file would be added to the command history.
- Fixed an issue where the `ping` and `tasklist` commands would fail to execute in a `.bub` file.
- Fixed an issue where BubbleOS would crash if it could not save a command to history in the configuration file, or read the history. If it encounters an error reading the file, it will now automatically reset the file and not crash BubbleOS.
- Fixed an issue where BubbleOS would crash when encountering an inaccessible directory in `dirtree`.
- Fixed an issue where changing the directory using the `cd` command into a symbolic link would not show where it pointed to in the success message.

- Removed the `--rm-tip` flag for the `sysinfo` command, since it is now managed automatically.
- Removed the `--no-tip` flag for the `help` command.
- Internally removed the `_replaceSpaces` function, since it is now unused.

## Build 135 to 148 (v1.3.5-beta to v1.4.8-beta)

### HOTFIX!

- Fixed an issue where running the `cls` and `exit` commands would crash BubbleOS, and in some cases in the `cd` command ([#14](https://github.com/viradex/bubbleos/issues/14)).

### Added Features

- The BubbleOS configuration file is now used to store command history across sessions.
- The `size` command can now get the size of a directory, and can now accept directory paths as a valid argument.
- Added a new text editor for the `mkfile` command to make it more user-friendly, featuring a multi-line editor to easily make new files without using the `*n` keyword for newlines.
- Internally added new verbose messages. These are currently unused in the code and will be introduced fully in the next version.

### Changed/Fixed Features

- The history in the configuration file is no longer saved and overwritten only when the `exit` command is run. Instead, the command will be saved every time the user inputs one.
- The `size` command will now automatically choose the best size to show (e.g. 6 GB over 6,000 MB).
- Updated the size conversion of BubbleOS to use correct conversion factors to follow the binary convention.
- Made commands by default not display in the `bub` command when executing a file.
- Updated help messages for commands to fix various grammar issues and other information.
- Fixed an issue where the time would display without a preceding 0 if the seconds/minutes was a single digit in the `time` command, fatal error file, and verbose messages.
- Fixed an issue where running the `size` command would crash BubbleOS.
- Fixed an issue where entering any value in a yes/no prompt would always abort the process after answering, even if "yes" was entered ([#10](https://github.com/viradex/bubbleos/issues/10)).
- Fixed an issue where entering the `echo` command would crash BubbleOS ([#12](https://github.com/viradex/bubbleos/issues/12)).
- Fixed an issue where if the error file was unable to be saved when a fatal error occurred, a fatal error would occur inside of the fatal error.
- Fixed an issue where BubbleOS would allow the `taskkill` command to kill itself, even when the `--kill-self` flag was not passed.
- Updated GitHub links to the new transfered repository.

### Removed Features

- Removed the arguments for the `size` command, as it now automatically chooses the best size to show. This may come back in a future version.
- Removed the ability to enter newlines in the `fif` search, due to it not functioning in the first place.
- Removed the `history` variable due to it now being stored in a separate file so that it can be used between sessions.

## Build 131 to 135 (v1.3.1-beta to v1.3.5-beta)

### Added Features

- Commands now have "hard aliases", which means typing in an alias will automatically run it instead of failing (e.g. `dir` runs the `ls` command). More will be added in future versions.

### Changed/Fixed Features

- Fixed an issue where running the `fif` command would crash BubbleOS.
- Updated heading color in the `fif` command to easily differentiate it.
- Changed the version text when running `-v` on the Bubble executable to be more consistent.
- When a fatal error completes, the user will be prompted to press the Enter key so that they can read the error.
- Changed key required to be pressed in the startup error from any key to just the Enter key, due to a previous unfixable bug.
- It is now less likely to get an unformatted error rather than a fatal error.

### Removed Features

- Removed some Easter eggs and references to Erik and B-Kernel due to less involvement in the project (but they will always be remembered ❤️).

## Build 125 to 131 (v1.2.5-beta to v1.3.1-beta)

### Added Features

- Added the `dirtree` command, which visually shows a directory tree of the folder specified and the files inside.
- The `ping` command will now follow redirects up to five times (after which it will fail with an error due to too many redirects).

### Changed/Fixed Features

- Updated the fatal error screen text and other related processes (e.g. the heap snapshot is no longer saved upon crashing).
